# Forward Chaining Tic-Tac-Toe Solver
# Accepts input as follows:
# -----------------------------------
# x b x
# b b b
# o b o
# ABOVE board-state input as:
# > python fc.py ttt.kb "x11 b12 x13 b21 b22 b23 o31 b32 o33 turn_o"
# ...
# move_o32_can_win
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# NOTE ttt.kb is knowledge base of positive literals followed by a consonant
# A B C D  which means A ^ B ^ C -> D
# Propositional symbos can have multiple characters, digits, and underscore
